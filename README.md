# SmartTyrePulse

## 🚀 Overview

SmartTyrePulse is an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) system meticulously developed to provide real-time, comprehensive monitoring of tyre performance. Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, this system integrates advanced sensor fusion techniques to calculate **Ton-Kilometer Per Hour (TKPH)** in real-time, alongside monitoring critical parameters like load, temperature, and speed.

Our solution empowers predictive maintenance strategies, significantly reducing operational downtime and enhancing vehicle safety and efficiency.

## ✨ Features

  * **Real-time TKPH Calculation:** Accurately calculates TKPH on the fly by fusing data from multiple sensors.
  * **Multi-sensor Integration:** Monitors key tyre performance metrics including:
      * Load
      * Temperature
      * Speed
  * **BLE-based Communication:** Ensures efficient and low-power data transmission from tyre sensors to the monitoring system.
  * **Predictive Maintenance:** Enables proactive identification of potential tyre issues, contributing to a **25% reduction in downtime**.
  * **Modular Design:** Built with a modular architecture for high deployability and easy integration into various vehicle types and existing systems.
  * **Agile Development:** Developed using Agile methodologies, ensuring flexibility, continuous improvement, and responsiveness to evolving requirements.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Flutter:** For building cross-platform mobile applications (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop) to display and interact with sensor data.
  * **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** For efficient wireless communication with the IoT sensors.
  * **IoT Sensors:** (Specify types if known, e.g., pressure sensors, temperature sensors, load cells, speed sensors)
  * **Data Fusion Algorithms:** For combining data from disparate sensors into meaningful insights (e.g., Kalman filters, complementary filters - if applicable, otherwise keep it general).
  * **Backend/Cloud Platform:** (If applicable, e.g., Firebase, AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT Core, custom backend)
